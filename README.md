# Free Model Foundary Fusesoc cores

[Free model foundary](https://freemodelfoundry.com) provides functional and
timing simulation models of Flash, RAM and FIFO chips to help with testing
FPGA/ASIC designs during simulation.

This repo provides free model foundary models as [fusesoc](https://www.librecores.org/olofk/FuseSoC)
cores.

This is a development/hosting repo only users should look to `fusesoc-cores`.
